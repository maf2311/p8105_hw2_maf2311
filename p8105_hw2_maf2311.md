# Problem 1

NYC Transit Entry/Exit Dataset Description:

The NYC Transit Entry/Exit Dataset has the following variables: line,
station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1, route2,
route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10,
route11, entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, ada. To clean the
data, I first imported the csv file, made the names more uniform with
the janitor package, and only kept the variables of interest. The binary
variable ‘entry’ was changed to a logical variable using the mutate
function. The NYC Transit Entry/Exit Dataset dataset has 1868 rows and
20 columns. These data are tidier than when I first imported the
dataset, however we can update the variable names (specifically the
route variables) to make them more user friendly.

``` r
stn = 
  nyc_subway %>% 
  select(line, station_name) %>% 
  distinct

compliant = 
  nyc_subway %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>%
  select(line, station_name) %>% 
  distinct

ent=
  nyc_subway %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

-   There are 465 distinct stations.
-   There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant.
-   The proportion f station entrances/exits without vending that allow
    entrance is 0.3770492.

# Problem 2

``` r
mrTrashWheel = 
  read_excel("./Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", skip = 1, n_max = 547) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(-x15, -x16) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0)) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)) %>%
  mutate(mrORprof = 1)
```

    ## New names:
    ## • `` -> `...15`
    ## • `` -> `...16`

``` r
profTrashWheel = 
  read_excel("./Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", skip = 1, n_max = 94) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(mrORprof = 2)

trashwheel = 
  merge(mrTrashWheel, profTrashWheel, all = TRUE)
```

The Trashwheel Dataset has the following variables: dumpster, month,
year, date, weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles,
polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags,
homes_powered, mrORprof, sports_balls. There are 641 observations. The
variable ‘mrORprof’ distinguishes between Mr. Trash Wheel (1) and
Professor Trash Wheel (2).

``` r
filtered2 = 
  trashwheel %>%
  filter(mrORprof == 2)
weight = sum(filtered2$weight_tons)

filtered1 = 
  trashwheel %>%
  filter(mrORprof == 1 & year == "2020")
balls = sum(filtered1$sports_balls)
```

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel: 190.12
tons

The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020:
856 sports balls
